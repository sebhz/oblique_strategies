# Oblique strategies

A CLI script to display random Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies).

Cards text taken from [Gregory Taylor site](http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/).

Since I was more interested in the spirit rather than the letter of the card, and I do not own a real pack of cards, I made some minor factorization and editorial changes. So I do not guarantee all the texts are fully faithful to the actual cards. But they are very close.
